## What's Hochat?

It's a powerful HTML Comment plugin.

It is based on the Native Javascript and iframe (For the default theme and etc.). So don't worry about the browsers' compatible.

By using Hochat, Just click [Quick Start](quick-start)

## Why Hochat?

Maybe you have knew the [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) . Though it is so powerful, There's still some problem.

* It's too slow in mainland China for some reason.
* The way to comment is to complex (Write Comment->Login/Register DISQUS->Post comment)
* Its scalability is not high. You can not design your own style. It looks similar in all site!
* Documentation is too hard for the starter.

I know it is ok for some guys. But we are trying to figure out the NEW WAY to comment.
